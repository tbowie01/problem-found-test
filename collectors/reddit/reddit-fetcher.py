            Question: Anyone else frustrated with automating accounting desktop apps? I’m trying to automate form filling in our accounting software, and it’s been a nightmare. I set up these workflows to fill out forms in QuickBooks, but every time there’s a slight change in the app or an unexpected popup, everything falls apart. Feels like I’m just chasing my tail trying to fix these issues instead of focusing on my actual work. Does anyone know any solutions for this? Any tools or software you recommend? || Answer: Yeah, I hit the same wall with QuickBooks automations constantly breaking. Switched to Cyberdesk and it’s been way less fragile.
